# C# .Net Core Webhook Practice
## Summary
Webhooks are a way for web applications to automatically notify other applications when a certain event occurs. This allows for powerful integration between different applications and automation of tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention.

When the wehbook is setup the application sends the notication ("The Sender") in form of a HTTP request to a subscribed url; another application ("The receiver"). The reciever then process the request and performs any necessary actions based on the data included in the request.
